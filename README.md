### Automated Assessment

Please review the following notes about the way in which your project will be
automatically assess in GitHub Actions:

- If you have already installed the
  [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs
  the automated grading checks provided by
  [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
  repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
  `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
- Make sure that your project submission meets all of the baseline checks for
  your technical writing. With that said, it is also important for you to add
  new checks to the `gatorgrade.yml` file that you design to demonstrate that
  your program is working correctly. You should also make sure to add to the
  `build.yml` file at least one example of your program being executed in GitHub
  Actions. Ultimately, your project should furnish clear and convincing evidence
  that the program works correctly and achieves your proposed goals.

In addition to the automated assessment the long-term systems project, the
course instructor will read, assess, and provide feedback on all of the
technical writing and source code that you create during project completion.
